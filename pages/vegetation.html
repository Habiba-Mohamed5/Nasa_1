            <h2>From Green to Brown</h2>
            <p>
                At the turn of the millennium, the Amazon rainforest, often called the "lungs of the planet," was a vast, uninterrupted sea of green. Data from the MODIS instrument aboard the Terra satellite provided an unprecedented baseline of global vegetation health, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as the years progressed, a worrying trend began to emerge. Between 2005 and 2012, increased deforestation for agriculture and logging began to leave visible scars on the landscape. The NDVI data shows a consistent decline during this period, indicating stressed or disappearing vegetation.
            </p>
            <h2>The Tipping Point</h2>
            <p>
                The period from 2013 onwards marked a critical acceleration in vegetation loss. This coincided with an increase in large-scale wildfires, another phenomenon tracked by Terra. The data tells a clear story: what was once a resilient ecosystem is now under severe threat, impacting global climate patterns and biodiversity.
